# Sudoku Design Spec

### Sections
1. User interface
2. Inputs and outputs

Inputs and outputs will be described according to the two major modes: ‘create’ and ‘solve’.

*Create*
The ‘creator’ will take no input aside from when calling the program to execute. It will output a newly created puzzle to stdout.

*Solve*
The ‘solver’ will take a sudoku puzzle through prompted user input through stdin. The program will then output the solved puzzle through stdout.

3. Functional decomposition into modules
4. Pseudo code
5. Dataflow through modules
6. Major data structures
7. Testing plan
