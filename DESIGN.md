### User Interface
./sudoku create or ./sudoku solve

We anticipate the following user interface:

The user will interact with the sudoku module when calling the program to execute with `./sudoku`. The program takes 1-2 arguments.
```
./sudoku mode difficulty_level
```
where *mode* is either “create” or “solve” to either create a sudoku puzzle or solve it, and 
*difficulty_level* is an optional parameter that takes an integer for the sudoku’s difficulty level to create. If the parameter isn’t given, the difficulty level is automatically 1.

For example:
```
./sudoku create 3
```
The two modes––create and solve––will be the two acceptable command-line arguments that dictate how the program will run. The argument `create` will prompt the program to build a new sudoku puzzle while the argument `solve` will instruct the program to solve a sudoku puzzle that the user is required to provide through stdin.

Beyond calling the program, we anticipate further interactions with the user, specifically relating to setting the difficulty of sudoku puzzles generated by the ‘creator’. The program will prompt the user to select a difficulty level, and the creator will design a puzzle accordingly.
***This last part is if we decide to implement a set_difficulty feature
